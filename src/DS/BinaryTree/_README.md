# Data Structures and Algorithm Practice

Welcome to my repository dedicated to studying data structures and algorithms. This repo is designed to help me improve my problem-solving skills by doing daily LeetCode challenges and tackling the Grind 75 list.

## Introduction

This repository is created to document my journey in learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. It contains solutions to various problems, notes on different data structures, and other relevant resources.

## Daily Challenges

Every day, I solve at least one problem from LeetCode. The solutions are organized in the `daily-challenges` directory

## Grind 75
The Grind 75 list consists of 75 curated problems that cover a wide range of topics. These problems help build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms. Solutions to these problems are organized in the `grind-75` directory.

## Data Structures

In this section, I explore various data structures and their implementations. Each data structure has its own directory, which includes:

- A brief description
- Implementation in different languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++)
- Example usage
- Important concepts and operations

### List of Data Structures

- [Arrays](./data-structures/arrays)
- [Linked Lists](./data-structures/linked-lists)
- [Stacks](./data-structures/stacks)
- [Queues](./data-structures/queues)
- [Trees](./data-structures/trees)
- [Graphs](./data-structures/graphs)
- [Heaps](./data-structures/heaps)
- [Hash Tables](./data-structures/hash-tables)
